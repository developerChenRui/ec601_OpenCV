  Hello Everyone! :trollface::trollface::trollface::trollface:
  
  This is the page for **EC601(Fall 2017) A1 OpenCV Exercise**

## Exercise 1
1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the
order of the pixel structure?


## Exercise 2
1. ColorImage.cpp is a program that takes a look at colorspace conversions in OpenCV. Run the code in ColorImage.cpp and comment on the outputs. Implement the same thing in Python and save each image.

2. Print out the values of the pixel at (20,25) in the RGB, YCbCr and HSV versions of the image. What are the ranges of pixel values in each channel of each of the above mentioned colorspaces?

## Exercise 3
1. Look at the code in Noise.cpp and implement the code in Python. Also, print the results for different noise values in the Gaussian case, mean = 0, 5, 10, 20 and sigma = 0, 20, 50, 100 and for the salt-and-pepper case, pa = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.4 and pb = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.4.

2. Change the kernel sizes for all the filters with all different values for noises and print the results for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 kernels. Comment on the results. Which filter seems to work ”better” for images with salt-and-pepper noise and gaussian noise?


## Exercise 4
1. Look at Threshold.cpp and implement the code in Python, and observe the results for different threshold values. Comment on the results.

2. What are the disadvantages of binary threshold?

3. When is Adaptive Threshold useful?
